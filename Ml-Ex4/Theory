Neural Networks: Representation

Andrew Ng

Welcome to week 4! This week, we are covering neural networks. 
Neural networks is a model inspired by how the brain works. It is widely used today in many applications: when
your phone interprets and understand your voice commands, it is likely that a neural network is helping to 
understand your speech; when you cash a check, the machines that automatically read the digits also use neural networks.
